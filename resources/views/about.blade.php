    <h3>Why Heirloom Seeds?</h3>
      <h4>Taste</h4>
      <blockquote>Foods grown from heirloom seeds often simply taste better than commercially-grown varieties.</blockquote>
      <h4>Nutrition</h4>
      <blockquote>Because modern seed stocks are developed with an eye to higher yields, crops are often less nutritious than lower-yielding heirlooms.</blockquote>
      <h4>Open Pollination</h4>
      <blockquote>Heirloom seeds generally propagate naturally, whereas modern hybrid seed stocks often pollinate poorly..</blockquote>
      <h4>Greater Variety</h4>
      <blockquote>While modern seed crops are generally bred for uniform ripening, which benefits comercial haresting.  Heirloom seeds, by contrast, will often produce throughout a longer growing season.</blockquote>
      <h4>Affordability</h4>
      <blockquote>Genetically modified (GMO) and other modern hybrid seeds are often proprietary commercial products, costing more than similar heirloom seeds.</blockquote>
      <h4>Personal Stories</h4>
      <blockquote>Heirloom seeds often have fascinating histories. Learn how they originally came to be cultivated and maintained.</blockquote>
      <h4>Seeds Need Saving</h4>
      <blockquote>With factory farming techniques increasing, crop yields are up at the expense of seed diversity.  A relatively few number of hybrid seeds grow most of our supermarket-destined crops.  This leaves genetic diversity diminished, consumer choice lessened, and the potential for catastrophic crop failure increased.</blockquote>
